	"tagInfo1": "Paintball and Airsoft specialist since 2005 & more than 27 years of experience in both fields, we have reinvented games that used to be played by kids and now adapted to children, teenagers and adults. We have mixed classic games such as dodgeball, tag, running and flag football with a score system. The game concept was developed by Daniel Fournier owner of Fort Ouest and his team.",
